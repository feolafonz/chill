# Powershell and Scripts you should ignore
> Just practicing GitHub and powershell scripts. Its a mess here. Making an effort to be clean


You will see my saved powershell scripts from Sysadmin work. Some I wrote, some are copyed, some are just updates.  Purpose of repo is to collect scripts for future use. I claim zero credit.  Trying my best to learn.
